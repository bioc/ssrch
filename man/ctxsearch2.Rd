\description{
ssrch demo with metadata documents from 68 cancer transcriptomics studies
}
\note{
The metadata were derived by extracting sample.attributes
fields from a search with github.com/seandavi/SRAdbV2.  The
sample.attributes content varies between studies and sometimes
between experiments within studies.  The field sets were
unified with the sampleAtts function of github.com/vjcitn/HumanTranscriptomeCompendium.  After unification records were stacked and CSVs were
written.
